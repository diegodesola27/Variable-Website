        <p> I am a Salvadorian product designer that blends innovative technology with compelling aesthetics. My expertise include working in the music industry, where I integrated design principles to enhance user experiences. At a leading app and website design company, where I collaborated with high-profile clients like the Miami Heat and Walmart, crafting engaging digital solutions that resonate with broad audiences.
        My passion for photography allows me to capture and design with a nuanced perspective, infusing visual storytelling into every project. This skill was especially instrumental in my role at a startup, where I helped develop a virtual reality platform that uses 3D models to transform how middle school students learn biology.
        Driven by a commitment to innovation and education, I continuously seek out new challenges and opportunities to apply my skills in product design and technology, aiming to inspire and improve the way we interact with the world around us.</p>
